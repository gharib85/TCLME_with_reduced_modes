Intramolecular Exciton Transfer Rates with Reduced Modes
=====
These are Mathematica notebooks for the paper on The Journal of Physical Chemistry A, 2014, 118(28), pp 5196-5203.
It calculates transfer rate constant from certain output of Q-Chem (see example outout files), and analyze the dominant nuclear motions in transfer (the primary Lanczos modes).
